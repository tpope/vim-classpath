This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION                                    *classpath*

This plugin automatically adjusts 'path' for languages that run on the JVM:
Java, Clojure, Scala, and Groovy.  Said path is determined by querying Maven
or Leiningen for the class path.  If neither is available, $CLASSPATH is used.

                                                *classpath-:Java*
:Java [args]            Execute $JAVA_CMD (default: java) with a class path
                        derived from the current buffer's path.

OFFLINE MODE                                    *g:classpath_offline*

By default when opening files the dependencies in 'project.clj' and 'pom.xml'
are downloaded which can be a security risk as well as leading to a hang when
the repositories are not reachable.
To prevent this add the following to your vimrc: >

    let g:classpath_offline = 1

In this case the plugin falls back to `$CLASSPATH`.
